# Portfolio ‚Äì Realsanjeev 2025

> Not a front-end developer, but I keep shipping anyway.

This is my personal portfolio built with **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. It‚Äôs fast, lightweight, and deployed using **GitHub Actions** to **GitHub Pages**.

## üåê Deploying a Vite App to GitHub Pages

To deploy your Vite project to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

### 1. Build the Production App

Run the build command to generate the static files:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist/` directory containing your production-ready app.

---

### 2. Configure `vite.config.js`

Update your `vite.config.js` to set the correct base path for GitHub Pages:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/your-repo-name/', // replace with your GitHub repo name
})
```

This ensures the correct asset paths when served from GitHub Pages.

---

### 3. Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a workflow file to automate the deployment:

**Path:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

This workflow will:

* Build your app
* Deploy the `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`

---

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages

Go to your repository's:

**Settings ‚Üí Pages**

* Set the source to **GitHub Actions** (or to the `gh-pages` branch if created by the workflow).

---

### 5. Access Your Deployed Site

Once deployed, your site will be available at:

```
https://{your-username}.github.io/{your-repo-name}/
```

Make sure to replace `{your-username}` and `{your-repo-name}` accordingly.

## üõ† Tech Stack

* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)

---

## üì¶ Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs the app locally at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

---

## üìù Notes

* Make sure the `base` path in `vite.config.js` matches your repo name exactly.
* This setup uses **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment. No need to manually run deploy scripts.
* For custom domains, add a `CNAME` file to the `public/` directory.
